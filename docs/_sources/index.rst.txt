modformPro Documentation
========================
**modformPro** is a software application to estimate modform region of proteins containing multiple modification sites. The software requires peak area measurments from Intact mass spectrometry and/or Bottom-up mass spectrometry as essential input information. It also provides options to simulate the modform distribution and subsequently the mass spectrometry measurement process to estimate modform region.

The software can handle multiple types of modifications on the same residues. The input files must comply with a certain structure and format that can be read by the software (See Tutorial for the same).
